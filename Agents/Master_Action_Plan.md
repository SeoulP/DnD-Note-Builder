# TTRPG Companion App — Master Action Plan
*March 2026 · v1.1 · Consolidated from Model, UI, Session Feedback, and Navigation/UX plans*

---

## Guiding Rules

> **No destructive migrations.** The schema is frozen for tables with existing data. All changes must be additive: new columns with defaults, new join tables, new tables only.
>
> **Types are seeded, not hardcoded.** All "type" fields use per-campaign seeded models, not enums. Users can add, rename, and delete entries.
>
> **Fix before building.** All bugs and compile errors are resolved before new features.

## Features

### F1 — Standardize Image Save Location to `imgs/` Folder

Currently `entity_images.path` stores whatever absolute path the user picked. This is machine-specific, breaks on migration, and blocks image export (F10).

**Plan:** When the user picks or drops an image, copy it into a managed folder before recording the path:
```
OS.GetUserDataDir()/imgs/<entity_type>/<entity_id>/<original_filename>
```
Store only the relative path (e.g. `imgs/npc/42/portrait.png`) in the DB. On load, resolve to absolute using `OS.GetUserDataDir()`.

**Backwards compatibility:** If a stored path starts with `/` or a drive letter, treat it as a legacy absolute path — do not break existing images.

**Files:**
- `ImageCarousel.cs` — copy file to managed path on pick/drop; store relative path
- `EntityImageRepository.cs` — no schema change; path convention only
- All image display code — resolve relative paths before loading texture

**Folder structure:**
```
%APPDATA%/Godot/app_userdata/dnd-builder/
  campaign.db
  imgs/
    npc/42/portrait.png
    location/7/map.jpg
```

> **Prerequisite for F10 (image export/import).**

---

### F2 — Per-Tab Back/Forward Navigation

**New file: `Scenes/Components/TabHistory.cs`**
```csharp
public class TabHistory
{
    private readonly List<(string EntityType, int EntityId)> _stack = new();
    private int _index = -1;

    public bool CanGoBack    => _index > 0;
    public bool CanGoForward => _index < _stack.Count - 1;
    public (string EntityType, int EntityId) Current => _stack[_index];

    public void Push(string entityType, int entityId)
    {
        if (_index >= 0 && _stack[_index] == (entityType, entityId)) return;
        _stack.RemoveRange(_index + 1, _stack.Count - _index - 1);
        _stack.Add((entityType, entityId));
        _index++;
    }

    public (string EntityType, int EntityId) Back()    { if (CanGoBack)    _index--; return Current; }
    public (string EntityType, int EntityId) Forward() { if (CanGoForward) _index++; return Current; }
}
```

**`CampaignDashboard.cs` changes:**
- Add `private TabHistory _history = new();` (non-readonly — needs reset on campaign switch).
- Add `[Export] private Button _backButton` and `[Export] private Button _forwardButton`.
- Split `ShowDetailPane` into `NavigateToInternal(string entityType, int entityId, bool pushHistory)`.
  - `pushHistory: true` → `_history.Push(...)` then `RefreshNavButtons()`.
  - `pushHistory: false` → skip push (used by back/forward traversal).
- `_backButton.Pressed` → `NavigateToInternal(_history.Back(), pushHistory: false)`.
- `_forwardButton.Pressed` → `NavigateToInternal(_history.Forward(), pushHistory: false)`.
- `RefreshNavButtons()` sets `Disabled` from `_history.CanGoBack` / `CanGoForward`.
- Reset `_history` in `SetCampaign()`.

**Mouse side-buttons — `_UnhandledInput` in `CampaignDashboard`:**
```csharp
public override void _UnhandledInput(InputEvent e)
{
    if (e is InputEventMouseButton { Pressed: true } mb)
    {
        if (mb.ButtonIndex == MouseButton.Xbutton1 && _history.CanGoBack)
        { NavigateToInternal(_history.Back(), pushHistory: false); AcceptEvent(); }
        else if (mb.ButtonIndex == MouseButton.Xbutton2 && _history.CanGoForward)
        { NavigateToInternal(_history.Forward(), pushHistory: false); AcceptEvent(); }
    }
}
```

**`CampaignDashboard.tscn`:** Add a small `HBoxContainer` with `←` and `→` flat buttons above or inset into `_detailPanel`. Wire exports.

---

### F3 — Session Related-Links Panel ✅

*(See Completed Work Log)*

---

### F4 — NPC Detail Pane: Home Location Field 🔶 Partial

Status and RelationshipTypeId dropdowns are done. Remaining field worth adding:

| Field | Source | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `HomeLocationId` | `Npc` | Add Location `TypeOptionButton` to NPC pane |

`Personality` and `FirstSeenSession` deferred — personality isn't a priority, and first-seen session is better handled as part of the F12 session pane redesign.

---

### F5 — Bulk Type Management Screen

A dedicated screen for managing all per-campaign seeded types in one place — useful for pre-session prep without having to open individual records. The inline `TypeOptionButton` already handles add/delete on the fly; this is purely a convenience screen for bulk editing.

**Recommended approach:** One `CampaignSettingsModal` scene with a `TabContainer`. Each tab is an instance of a shared `TypeEditorPanel` subscene (list + name input + Add/Delete buttons). Each tab wired to a different repository.

**Tables to manage:**

| Tab | Repository | Table |
|-----|------------|-------|
| Species | `SpeciesRepository` | `species` |
| NPC Statuses | `NpcStatusRepository` | `npc_statuses` |
| NPC Relationships | `NpcRelationshipTypeRepository` | `npc_relationship_types` |
| Faction Roles | `NpcFactionRoleRepository` | `npc_faction_roles` |
| Item Types | `ItemTypeRepository` | `item_types` |

> Do not allow deleting a type that any records currently reference — warn the user before deletion.

---

### F6 — Nested Locations in Sidebar ✅

*(See Completed Work Log)*

---

### F7 — Campaign Cover Image

Add `Campaign` to the `EntityType` enum in `EntityType.cs`. Everything else (`EntityImageRepository`, `ImageCarousel`) already works generically for any entity type. No other data layer changes required.

---

### F8 — Players Section: Party Overview

`PlayerCharacter.cs` model exists. Full PC mechanics are deferred to F9.

**Scope:**
- Add a Players accordion to `CampaignDashboard` alongside the existing sections.
- Detail pane shows: name, species, class, level — basic identifying information only.

---

### F9 — PC Abilities / Class Features

**New `abilities` table:**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | |
| `player_character_id` | INTEGER FK | → `player_characters(id)` |
| `name` | TEXT | |
| `type` | TEXT | Class Feature, Maneuver, Feat, etc. |
| `action` | TEXT | Action / Bonus Action / Reaction / Passive / Free |
| `trigger` | TEXT | Optional — e.g. "When you miss an attack" |
| `cost` | TEXT | Optional — e.g. "1 Superiority Die" |
| `uses` | INTEGER | Max uses (0 = unlimited) |
| `uses_remaining` | INTEGER | Current remaining uses |
| `recovery` | TEXT | e.g. "Short Rest", "+1 per Short Rest" |
| `effect` | TEXT | Full description |
| `notes` | TEXT | Rulings and reminders |
| `sort_order` | INTEGER | Display order within character sheet |

---

### F10 — Image Export/Import in `.dndx` Packages

**Dependency: F1 must be complete first.** Without a managed `imgs/` folder there is no reliable way to find image files during export.

**Approach:** Embed images as base64 in the JSON. Each exported entity image becomes a record in `ExportPackage.Images`:
- `EntityType`, `OldEntityId`, `Filename`, `Data` (base64 bytes)

On import: decode base64 → write file to `imgs/<entity_type>/<new_entity_id>/<filename>` → insert `entity_images` row with remapped entity ID.

**Files:** `ExportPackage.cs`, `ImportExportService.BuildPackage()`, `ImportExportService.ApplyPackage()`, `ImportExportModal.cs` (optional "Include Images" checkbox).

**Alternative (deferred):** Package `.dndx` as a `.zip` containing `data.json` + `imgs/` folder. More efficient for large images but requires a zip library. Defer unless base64 file sizes become a problem.

---

### F11 — NPC–Location Relationship 🚫 No Decision

A single location field on an NPC conflates three distinct concepts:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Home / Origin | Where they are from or based. Stable, set during prep. |
| Current Location | Where they are right now. Changes during play. |
| Last Seen | Session-stamped observation — "As of Session 12, spotted in Waterdeep." |

**Options under consideration:**
1. Two optional fields on `Npc`: `HomeLocationId` (FK already exists) + `LastSeenNote` (freetext with optional session reference).
2. A join table `npc_locations` with `location_id`, `session_id`, `note` — a full history.

> Option 1 is simpler and covers most DM use cases. Option 2 is more powerful but adds complexity before the need is proven. No decision yet — revisit when building the NPC pane update (F4).

---

### F12 — Session Detail Pane: Significant Redesign 🔶 In Progress

The current pane has: number label, title, played-on date, wiki notes, image carousel, delete. Most-used pane during active play; confirmed as the biggest active pain point from live session use.

**Confirmed missing (from live session feedback):**
- Abilities panel — quick reference during combat
- Quick-create for entities from within the session (tracked as F18 — see below)
- WikiLink coverage gap — Items and Quests not linked (tracked as F17)
- Bullet point support in notes (tracked as U5)

**Previously planned — still applies:**
- Entity tagging panel — structured fields for which NPCs, locations, factions, and quests appeared
- Inline stub creation — create a new NPC or location without losing place
- Wiki link hover preview — hovering a `[[Link]]` shows a preview without navigating
- Quest status updates — log progress on a quest from within session notes

> Plan together with F13 (Tab system) — they are the same body of work.

---

### F13 — Tab System for the Detail Pane ✅

*(See Completed Work Log)*

---

### F14 — Remember Last Opened Entity Per Campaign ✅

*(See Completed Work Log — superseded by full tab restoration via "Remember Tabs" setting)*

---

### F15 — NPC–NPC Relationships: Directionality Display ✅

*(See Completed Work Log)*

---

### F16 — Call SeedDefaults on Campaign Load

All `SeedDefaults` implementations already use `INSERT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS (... AND name = @name)` — they are fully idempotent and safe to call repeatedly. The only gap is they are currently only called from `DatabaseService` at campaign *creation*, not on subsequent loads.

**Fix — `DatabaseService.cs` or `CampaignDashboard.SetCampaign()`:** Call all `SeedDefaults` on campaign load, not just on creation. Because all the INSERT guards are already in place, this is safe for existing campaigns with real data.

```csharp
// Call in SetCampaign or wherever a campaign is opened:
_db.Species.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.LocationFactionRoles.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.NpcFactionRoles.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.NpcRelationshipTypes.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.NpcStatuses.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.FactionRelationshipTypes.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.CharacterRelationshipTypes.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.ItemTypes.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
_db.QuestStatuses.SeedDefaults(campaignId);
```

This also means any new seeds added to a `Defaults` array in the future will automatically appear in existing campaigns on next open — making F16 the permanent solution, not a one-time patch.

**New seeds to add at the same time:**

| Repository | New entry |
|------------|-----------|
| `CharacterRelationshipTypeRepository` | `("Worships", "Reveres as a deity or divine figure")` |
| `NpcFactionRoleRepository` | `("Worshipped by", "Venerated as a god or divine patron by this faction")` |

These will reach existing campaigns automatically once F16 is wired in.

---

### F17 — WikiNotes: Items and Quests in WikiLink Autocomplete ✅

*(See Completed Work Log)*

---

### F18 — WikiNotes: Stub Creation via `[[+NoteType]]` Syntax ✅

*(See Completed Work Log)*

---

## Implementation Order

### Short-term
1. **F16 — Call SeedDefaults on campaign load** — trivial wiring; ships the God/Worship seeds too.
2. **F2 — Per-tab back/forward navigation** — builds on existing tab system; `TabHistory` helper + back/forward buttons.

### Medium-term
5. **F4 — NPC pane: Home Location field** — small addition, finish the partial work.
6. **F1 — Standardize image save location** — prerequisite for F10.
7. **F5 — Bulk type management screen** — convenience, not blocking anything.
8. **F8 — Players section** — basic party overview.

### Planned / Larger scope
9. **F9 — PC abilities / class features** — new table, greenfield.
10. **F12 — Session redesign** — entity tagging, inline stub creation, wiki hover preview.
11. **F10 — Image export/import** — requires F1.
12. **F7 — Campaign cover image** — one enum entry; trivial but low priority.
13. **U5 — Bullet point continuation** — nice to have; defer until session redesign work.

### Blocked / No decision
- **F11 — NPC–Location relationship** — revisit later; design TBD.

## Completed Work Log

All items below are done and require no further action unless noted.

### Model (pre-alpha)
- ✅ `Faction.Headquarters` removed
- ✅ `Location.FactionIds` → `LocationFaction` join model
- ✅ `LocationFactionRole` seeded model created
- ✅ `NpcRelationship` enum → `NpcRelationshipType` seeded model
- ✅ `Npc` refactored into `Character` base + `Npc` + `PlayerCharacter` (Table-Per-Type)
- ✅ `NpcStatus` enum → `NpcStatus` seeded model
- ✅ Item system: `Item`, `ItemType`, `SystemItem`, `DnD5eItemMechanics`, `CharacterItem`, `LocationItem`

### UI / Compile fixes
- ✅ `FactionDetailPane` — Headquarters removed
- ✅ `LocationDetailPane` — `FactionIds` → `Factions.Select(f => f.FactionId)`
- ✅ `NpcDetailPane` — enum dropdowns replaced with DB-loaded dropdowns (Status + RelationshipType)
- ✅ Item list + detail pane
- ✅ Entity image carousel system (`ImageCarousel`, `ImageLightbox`, `EntityImageRepository`, all five detail panes wired)

### UX Polish (2026-03-19)
- ✅ U2 — EntityRow pointer cursor: `MouseDefaultCursorShape = CursorShape.PointingHand` on `navBtn` and `delBtn` inside `EntityRow._Ready()`.
- ✅ U1 — WikiNotes click-to-edit fully resolved: scroll position saved/restored around `GrabFocus`; caret placed at click position via `GetLineColumnAtPos`; `ScrollFitContentHeight = true` prevents scrollbar flicker; fonts/sizes matched between `TextEdit` and `RichTextLabel` via theme API; renderer stylebox tuned to match focused TextEdit layout (left margin = `focusSb.ContentMarginLeft`, top margin = `focusSb.ContentMarginTop + focusSb.BorderWidthTop * 2` to compensate for the 2 px layout shift when focus border activates); `caret_blink = true` added to `wiki_notes.tscn`.

### Image loading (2026-03-19)
- ✅ B1 — Image load bug fixed: `ImageCarousel` and `ImageLightbox` now read raw bytes via `System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes` and detect format from magic bytes (PNG/JPEG/WebP), bypassing Godot's extension-based loader. Handles files with mismatched extensions (e.g. WebP saved as .png).
- ✅ B2 — Drag-and-drop now works via `Window.FilesDropped` signal. Godot 4 does not route OS file drops through `_CanDropData`/`_DropData` — those are internal-only. Drop hover overlay was investigated and dropped: Godot 4 exposes no OS drag hover events, so reliable visual feedback during drag is not possible without platform-specific hooks.

### Visual / Theme polish (2026-03-20)
- ✅ U3 — Project-wide Godot theme (`theme.tres`): TextEdit + LineEdit steel-blue bg (`#334155`), violet focus ring (`#6d28d9`), rounded corners (r=5), transparent resting border; warm light text; `Label/colors/font_color` set globally.
- ✅ ThemeManager — `Core/ThemeManager.cs` autoload; HSV hue-shift approach: all themes are Slate's dark profile rotated to any hue (0–359°). Free hue slider + Dark/Light toggle + 4-stop saturation selector (Greyscale · Muted · Default · Vivid) in Settings → Appearance popup. Persisted via `SettingsRepository` (`app_settings` table, keys: `theme_hue`, `theme_dark`, `theme_sat`). NavBar bg and ImageCarousel bg (Component/700) update live via `ThemeChanged` signal. Special-case: hue=215 + dark + Default sat → exact Slate Tailwind hex values.
- ✅ App background `#1e293b` via `rendering/environment/defaults/default_clear_color` in `project.godot` (no Panel nodes in scene tree — clear colour is the correct mechanism).
- ✅ NavBar background `#0f172a` via inline StyleBoxFlat override in `nav_bar.tscn`.
- ✅ EntityRow + TypeOptionButton hover states read from `DndBuilder/styles/row_hover` + `delete_hover` in theme; fallback to hardcoded colours if theme lookup fails (prevents silent null-stylebox override bug).
- ✅ TypeOptionButton popup background from `PopupPanel/styles/panel` in theme.
- ✅ ImageCarousel background changed to `#1e293b` (app background), border to `#334155`; border width set to 0 (user preference).
- ✅ `margin_top = 8` restored on `Margin` node in all five detail panes that were missing it (npc, faction, location, session, item).
- ✅ `caret_blink = true` added to every LineEdit and TextEdit node across all detail panes, the dashboard search field, the new-campaign modal, and dynamically created TypeOptionButton search/add inputs.
- ✅ Global unfocus on blank click — `App._Input` override releases focus when a left-click lands outside the currently focused control. (`_UnhandledInput` was insufficient because detail panes are `ScrollContainer` roots which absorb mouse events before they reach unhandled input.)

### Session feedback
- ✅ Spacebar opens image importer from lightbox — fixed via `GetViewport().GuiReleaseFocus()` in `OpenLightbox()`
- ✅ Session sidebar — title only, no index prefix
- ✅ Wasted space left/right of app — `app.tscn` margins corrected; `SetMargins()` in `App.cs`
- ✅ Import / Export — Backup, Restore, Export Campaign Data, Import Campaign Data; `.dndx` JSON format
- ✅ All text areas auto-expand in edit mode (`WikiNotes`)
- ✅ Entity name fields select-all on focus (all detail panes)
- ✅ Lightbox cursor — pointer hand on carousel, Move cursor in lightbox
- ✅ OS-native file dialog (`DisplayServer.FileDialogShow()`)
- ✅ Navbar built out — campaign name, back button, settings menu
- ✅ "Acquainted with" NPC relationship seed added
- ✅ Notes last in all detail panes
- ✅ Detail pane footer — 24px breathing room at window bottom
- ✅ New sessions always append to end of sidebar list
- ✅ Settings menu tooltips
- ✅ Three-column layout (sidebar / detail / wiki panel)
- ✅ Quests entity + Quest History sub-feature
- ✅ NPC–NPC relationships — `character_relationships` table, full CRUD, `NpcDetailPane` panel with type/NPC pickers, add/remove/navigate. Both directions surface on both NPC panes via `OR related_character_id = @cid` query. Directionality display is a separate open design question (F15).

### UX Polish (2026-03-20)
- ✅ U4 — TypeOptionButton auto-select on add: `AutoSelectOnAdd = true` added before `Setup()` on all type dropdowns — `_speciesInput`, `_statusInput`, `_relationshipInput`, `_roleSelect`, `_relTypeSelect` (NPC); `_typeInput` (Item); `_statusInput` (Quest); `_roleSelect`, `_relFactionTypeSelect` (Faction); `_roleSelect` (Location). Entity-picker dropdowns already had it.

### Tab system (2026-03-20)
- ✅ F13 — Full tab system for the detail pane. `TabEntry` class with `ActionBtn` (combined pin/close), color swatch, per-tab `StyleBoxFlat` refs for live theme updates. `BuildTabWidget` + `BuildAddTabWidget` (mini-tab `+` at end of list). Navigation priority: existing tab → unpinned current → unpinned other → new tab. Right-click context menu: Close, Close All, Close All to Right, Pin/Unpin. Drag-and-drop reorder with ghost preview (`ZIndex=100` root-level control). Tab scrollbar hidden (`horizontal_scroll_mode = 3`). All tab colors sourced from `ThemeManager`; `OnTabThemeChanged` mutates `StyleBoxFlat.BgColor` in-place for live theme switching. `DeleteHoverColor` = dark crimson `Color(0.55f, 0.12f, 0.12f)` applied app-wide (tabs, EntityRow, TypeOptionButton).
- ✅ F14 — "Remember Tabs" setting. Full tab state (type, id, pinned, active index) serialized to JSON and persisted per-campaign via `app_settings`. `SaveTabs()` on every navigation; `RestoreTabs()` at end of `_Ready()`. Toggled via checkable Settings menu item; `HideOnCheckableItemSelection = false` keeps menu open on toggle.

### NPC Relationships (2026-03-22)
- ✅ F15 — NPC–NPC relationship directionality. Relationships are now **one-directional and independent per NPC**: each NPC manages their own rows (`WHERE character_id = @cid` only). Jorge adds "Master of Harold" from his pane; Harold separately adds "Friend of Jorge" from his pane — two unrelated DB rows. Schema: migration guard adds `to_type_id` column (unused, kept for additive-only rule); `relationship_type_id` remains the single type field. `RemoveRelationship` deletes only the specific directional row. Display always reads `"{currentNpc}, {type} {otherNpc}"`. NPC picker filter checks `RelatedCharacterId` only (not both directions). `RelationshipTypeOptionButton` component was built then abandoned in favour of keeping the standard `TypeOptionButton`. `TypeOptionButton` hover-×-disappear bug fixed: `delBtn.MouseExited` now resets `Modulate` to transparent.

### Session Related-Links Panel (2026-03-22)
- ✅ F3 — Session related-links panel. `RefreshRelatedLinks()` parses all `[[...]]` links from session notes, deduplicates in order of first appearance, and builds a name→(type, id) lookup across all six entity types. Links are grouped into collapsible sections (▼/▶ toggle, showing count) in fixed type order: NPCs → Factions → Locations → Sessions → Items → Quests → Not Found. Resolved links render as flat gold buttons (`#d4aa70`) with pointing-hand cursor and emit `NavigateTo` on press. Unresolved links render as grey disabled buttons (arrow cursor). All buttons have `StyleBoxEmpty` padding stripped so height matches font size, with `TextOverrunBehavior.TrimEllipsis` overflow protection. Items are indented 24px under their section header via a `MarginContainer`. Panel is hidden when no links are present. Fires live on every `_notes.TextChanged`; skips rebuild if the set of link names is unchanged.

### UX Polish (2026-03-22)
- ✅ U5 — WikiNotes bullet continuation: `- ` prefix on a line auto-continues on Enter (new `- ` line inserted). Enter on an empty `- ` body removes the prefix. `OnInputKey` early-return guard relaxed — `HandleBulletContinuation()` now fires when autocomplete is not visible; autocomplete-only keys (Escape, Up, Down, Tab) guard themselves individually.

### WikiNotes improvements (2026-03-20)
- ✅ F17 — Items and Quests added to `[[` autocomplete (`WikiNotes.GetEntityMatches()`) and to link rendering (`WikiLinkParser.BuildLookup()`). All six entity types now suggest and render as navigable gold links.
- ✅ F18 — Stub creation via `[[+NoteType]]` syntax. Typing `[[+NPC]]`, `[[+Location]]`, `[[+Item]]`, `[[+Faction]]`, or `[[+Quest]]` (closing `]]` triggers the modal) opens a name-prompt popup. Confirming creates a stub record, replaces the trigger with `[[Name]]`, and refreshes the sidebar via `EntityCreated` signal wired through all six detail panes and `CampaignDashboard`. Escape removes the trigger text. Footer hint added to `wiki_notes.tscn`: `[[Name]] links to a note  ·  [[+NoteType]] creates a new one  (NPC, Location, Item, Faction, Quest)`.
